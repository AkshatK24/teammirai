# Themed Storytelling Website


Welcome to the Themed Storytelling Website! This project is designed to immerse users in a world of interactive storytelling. As you progress through the story, you'll experience various interactive challenges that will help unfold the narrative. Each element of the site has been crafted to engage you and bring the story to life.





## Features

- **3D CSS Navigation**

    The navigation is brought to life using CSS 3D transforms, creating an interactive and dynamic experience. The navigation menu uses a 3D effect to give a sense of depth, allowing users to explore the website in an innovative and visually appealing way. With smooth transitions and subtle animations, it feels like you're diving into the story as you explore sections.

    Hover Effects: Navigation items animate when hovered over, giving the user an intuitive sense of movement.
    Smooth Transitions: The page layout shifts and transitions seamlessly using CSS 3D, enhancing the user experience.
